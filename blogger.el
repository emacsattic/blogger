;;; Commentary:

;; blogger.el implements the Blogger API to talk to weblog software.
;;
;; For ease of use:
;; I use the following commands in my .emacs file:
;;
;; (load-file "blogger.el")
;; (global-set-key "\C-cbs" 'blogger-start-post)
;;
;; C-c b s will switch to a new buffer where you can compose a
;; post.
;;
;; C-x C-s    -- post-and-publish current buffer to the blog.
;;               Calling blogger-save-post with an prefix argument
;;               (i.e. C-u C-c C-c) will prompt for which weblog
;;               to use.
;;
;; C-c C-c    -- identical to C-x C-s, but will also bury the buffer.
;;
;; C-c C-n    -- post (but not publish) the current message and
;;               load the next message.
;;
;; C-c C-p    -- post (but not publish) the current message and
;;               load the previous message.
;;
;; C-c C-k    -- delete the current post.
;;
;; M-g        -- synchronise blogger.el's idea of the posts available
;;               with the blogger server.
;;
;; ** TBD ** C-c C-t m  -- edit the main template.
;;
;; ** TBD ** C-c C-t a  -- edit the Archive Index template
;;
;;
;; Notes:
;; ----
;;
;; This code is based on Simon Kittle's blogger.el
;; (http://www.tswoam.co.uk/files/blogger.el.txt), but where his
;; code calls a Perl program, this code uses xml-rpc.el.  You can
;; get xml-rpc.el from <http://elisp.info/package/xml-rpc/>
;;
;; Differences between SK's blogger.el and this one:
;;
;; - Doesn't need any external programs.  Uses xml-rpc.el.
;; - I've added a bunch of defcustom's here to make this integrate
;;   better with Emacs Customization interface. 
;; - Created a *blogger* mode.
;; - Made selection of a blog more intuitive.  It queries the
;;   Blogger server and allows the user to choose the name of the
;;   blog from a list.
;; - Prompt for blog on initial post if blogger-id isn't set.
;; - Can "ping" http://weblogs.com/ and http://blo.gs/ whenever
;;   you update.
;; - Can "scroll" through posts on the blogger server and edit them.
;;
;; Todo:
;;
;;  * RSS creation
;;  * Implement MetaWeblog API
;;  * Implement MovableType extentions
;;
;; Bugs:
;;
;;  * When you delete a post it gets deleted, but it doesn't
;;  disappear from your post ring until you sync (M-g) with the server.
